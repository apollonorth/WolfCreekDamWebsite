# WolfCreekDamWebsite
A basic website I created to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Contains 12 webpages, each containing the data from Wolf Creek Dam for a different month from 2021. Utilized a Java program to automate the production of the 12 data table webpages.
Also contains a charts, maps, weblinks, and index page.
All of the HTML files are styled with CSS, and wesbite functionality such as the navigation menu and other buttons were created using JavaScript.
